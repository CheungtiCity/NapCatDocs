- Simple configuration, supports remote browser access for configuration, easy and simple to complete.

- Rapid adaptation to NTQQ functions, continuous updates to follow the latest version of QQ.

## Things to Know Before Starting (Read Three Times!)

:::warning

- NapCat is a QQ Bot framework based on the PC NTQQ client body, so you need to install the **QQ version corresponding to NapCatQQ** in advance to run NapCat.

- When NapCat is online, you cannot achieve human-computer unity using the PC QQ client, but you can choose to log in synchronously on the mobile client. If you want human-computer unity on PC, please use [LLOneBot](https://github.com/LLOneBot/LLOneBot).

- NapCat is different from protocol implementation; it is based on the QQ client. Things that cannot be done on the QQ client, NapCat >_< can't do it either!

## Configuration

To avoid secondary startup, you can pre-configure the basic settings of NapCat, see [Configure NapCat](./config.md).

## Startup

::: details Windows

After installing the corresponding version of QQ, in most cases, you only need to unzip NapCat and place it anywhere you want. But be careful, the path cannot contain spaces. Then, double-click `napcat.bat` to run!

Wait! If you encounter garbled characters, you can try double-clicking `napcat-utf8.bat` to start.

If the above method still does not work, you can try to start with PowerShell:

Start PowerShell, run `powershell ./napcat.ps1` or `napcat.bat`, if garbled characters appear, you can try to run `napcat-utf8.ps1` or `napcat-utf8.bat`.

If it still doesn't work, you can try `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\napcat.ps1"`.

**It is recommended to directly click the bat to run, because PowerShell itself will occupy about 20 MB of memory.**

::: details Linux One-Click Script

`curl -o napcat.sh https://nclatest.znin.net/NapNeko/NapCat-Installer/main/script/install.sh && sudo bash napcat.sh`
